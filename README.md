# Shooter game
## About this project
This is simply a project made from Python coding, also using Pygame. It's quite literally a shooter game, a game in which you shoot things. This is like, my first project ever uploaded to Github, so it might be bad in some areas.

## Additional info
### Controls:
A - Move left
D - Move right
SPACE - Fire bullet
*There is a reload time of 3 seconds after firing 5 bullets

### Just stuff:
Your character is a spaceship who is trying to shoot 10 UFOs dropping down at you, and evade the asteroids. You are only allowed 5 UFOs to go beyond your ship before you lose. You have 3 lives from colliding with UFOs or asteroids. Game may be glitchy and laggy, and unfortunately you have to restart the game every single time you lose or win. :/
